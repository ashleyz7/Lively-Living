## Lively Living

Our web application aims to solve homestay problem for both host family and students. Using our forum, host families will be able to post their houing introduction, and students will be able to scan through those posts to choose a suitable homestay and comment about their previous homestay experience with a specific host. In the forum page, student would be able to search by city/state/school, then click on the picture to see the details of a specific room.
